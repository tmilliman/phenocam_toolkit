# phenocam_toolkit
A collection of useful python routines for analyzing phenocam images.  

This collection of routines to analyze images from the [PhenoCam Network](https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/) has
been replaced with the python [vegindex](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/vegindex) package.  The simple approach
used here is still valid and is an easy introduction to the processing use by the PhenoCam team.  For more information
you can also see the collection of [PhenoCam notebooks](https://github.com/tmilliman/phenocam_notebooks).
